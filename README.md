## 📝 CRUD of the Chosen Entity

### Chosen Entity: Tasks
We chose the **Tasks** entity because it is central to the app's functionality: the main goal of the project is to manage tasks efficiently, so this entity represents the core of the system.  

### Implemented Features
- **Listing**: View all registered tasks.  
- **Creation**: Form to add a new task.  
- **Details**: Page to view detailed information about each task.  
- **Update**: Edit existing tasks.  
- **Deletion**: Remove tasks from the database.  

### Database Integration
- **Firebase Firestore** is used as a cloud database to store all tasks.  
- **Firebase Authentication** handles user login and registration.  
- The frontend built with **HTML, CSS, and Tailwind** communicates directly with Firebase using JavaScript (SDK).

### Challenges Encountered
- Integrating Firebase Authentication and Firestore CRUD with Vanilla JavaScript.
- Handling real-time updates using `onSnapshot`.
- Implementing form validation and managing login/registration modals.
- Ensuring proper user authentication and secure access to tasks.

### Validation and Security
- Form validation using HTML5 and JavaScript to ensure required fields are filled.  
- User authentication and Firebase security rules guarantee that only logged-in users can access their tasks. 
- **Note:** Since this project uses Firebase Firestore (NoSQL), SQL injection is not applicable. Firebase security rules enforce secure access for authenticated users only.

## 🚀 Usage

1. Open `index.html` in a browser.  
2. Register a new account or log in with existing credentials.  
3. After login, you are automatically redirected to `lista.html` to view your tasks.  
4. Create a new task using the “Add Task” form.  
5. Edit or delete tasks directly from the list.  
6. Use the logout button to safely exit your session.
