- Tasks stored safely in **Firebase Firestore**  
- Star Wars-inspired **UI and animations**  
- Responsive design with **HTML5 + CSS3 + Tailwind**  
- Interactive frontend powered by **Vanilla JavaScript (ES6)**  
- Full frontend-based CRUD operations with Firebase  

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
### Frontend  
- **HTML5** – semantic structure  
- **CSS3** – custom styles, responsive layout, Star Wars theme  
- **Tailwind CSS** – fast and responsive styling  
- **Vanilla JavaScript (ES6)** – DOM manipulation and Firebase integration  

### Backend / Services

## 📝 CRUD of the Chosen Entity

### Chosen Entity: Tasks
We chose the **Tasks** entity because it is central to the app's functionality: the main goal of the project is to manage tasks efficiently, so this entity represents the core of the system.  

### Implemented Features
- **Listing**: View all registered tasks.  
- **Creation**: Form to add a new task.  
- **Details**: Page to view detailed information about each task.  
- **Update**: Edit existing tasks.  
- **Deletion**: Remove tasks from the database.  

### Database Integration
- **Firebase Firestore** is used as a cloud database to store all tasks.  
- **Firebase Authentication** handles user login and registration.  
- The frontend built with **HTML, CSS, and Tailwind** communicates directly with Firebase using JavaScript (SDK).

### Challenges Encountered
- Integrating Firebase Authentication and Firestore CRUD with Vanilla JavaScript.
- Handling real-time updates using `onSnapshot`.
- Implementing form validation and managing login/registration modals.
- Ensuring proper user authentication and secure access to tasks.

### Validation and Security
- Form validation using HTML5 and JavaScript to ensure required fields are filled.  
- User authentication and Firebase security rules guarantee that only logged-in users can access their tasks. 
- **Note:** Since this project uses Firebase Firestore (NoSQL), SQL injection is not applicable. Firebase security rules enforce secure access for authenticated users only.

---

## 🚀 Usage

1. Open `index.html` in a browser.  
2. Register a new account or log in with existing credentials.  
3. After login, you are automatically redirected to `lista.html` to view your tasks.  
4. Create a new task using the “Add Task” form.  
5. Edit or delete tasks directly from the list.  
6. Use the logout button to safely exit your session.

## 🔒 Security Enhancement — User Access Levels

This update focuses on improving the system’s security by implementing **user access levels** through the `role` field in Firestore.

### 🧩 Implementation Details

- Added a new field `role` to the `users` collection in Firestore.
- When a user registers, the system automatically assigns:

  ```json
  {
    "email": "user@example.com",
    "name": "Luke Skywalker",
    "role": "user"
  }
  ```

The default role is `"user"`.

Administrators (`"admin"`) are managed directly through the **Firebase Console**, which already provides secure access to all data.

---

### ⚙️ CRUD Restrictions by Role

- **Users (`role: "user"`)** can only create, view, update, and delete their own tasks.  
- This is enforced by **Firestore Security Rules** that match each document to the authenticated user’s **UID**.  
- **Admins (`role: "admin"`)** have full database access through Firebase’s management interface.

---

### 🧱 Technical Approach

- Used **Firebase Authentication** for session control (acting as middleware for routes).  
- Used **Firestore Security Rules** to restrict access by user ID (UID).  
- Each user’s data and tasks are isolated — no user can read or modify another’s information.  
- Admin access is handled natively by Firebase, ensuring data integrity and safety.

---

### ✅ Why This Meets the Objective

This solution satisfies all the requirements:

- Added a `role` field to the users table.  
- Restricted CRUD actions according to user role.  
- Used session validation (**Firebase Auth**) as the middleware layer to control access.
